# Reflection

# i have addressed the six user stories and two edge cases
# I have used mocking to account for stormy and sunny weather
# SRP has been adhered to by extracting code from the land and 
# take_off methods into private methods.
# Test coverage for the airport class is good.
# Test coverage for the weather class currently is very poor. 
# This is because I haven't tested the random number generator yet.
